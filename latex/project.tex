\section{Introduction}
Defect report is commonly a structured natural language artifact generated during the software reliability engineering process.
A well-structured defect report would be very informative to viewers and very efficient for knowledge acquisition purpose.
The previous experience (or knowledge) of handling a specific type of defect would be critical to the success of the future defect analysis.
However, retrieving knowledge from the historical defect reports could be a painful job especially when the volume of reports is high enough.
Based on the experience of a well-known telecommunication equipment company in China, the number of their historical defect reports has reached 3 million and the number of newly generated defect reports is about 30 thousand each month.
Without an appropriate approach to standardize, formalize, and organize the historical defect reports, it is basically impossible to retrieve knowledge from the gigantic pool of reports.\par

Ontology, as a formal and explicit specification of a shared conceptualization with a complex semantic web structure, is able to standardize and formalize a domain knowledge or the expert interpretation \cite{christina2016an}.
With orthogonal defect classification (ODC), we can not only classify the defect reports into a few specific types but also fit newly generated defect reports into some pre-determined workflows to improve the engineering efficiency.
Both approaches are able to contribute the the objective of improving the knowledge acquisition tasks in software reliability engineering regarding defect anaylsis. 
It might be more beneficial to have them combined as one mechanism since one plus one can be more than two.
Knowledge Graph (KG), which integrates information from various types of resources into an ontology and also applies a reasoning engine to assist deriving new knowledge \cite{ehrlinger2016towards}, is promising to integrate the ODC results of historical defect reports with the ontology, as well as, effectively and efficiently achieve certain types of knowledge acquisition tasks.
This project aims at conducting a feasibility study to explore the methodoly to build a KG from historical defect reports with ODC.

\subsection{Orthogonal Defect Classification}
Orthogonal defect classification (ODC) has been known to reduce the effort of defect analysis especially for root cause analysis \cite{buglione2006introducing}.
